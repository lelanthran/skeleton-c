# Skeleton Makefile for C and C++ projects.

There are two example projects, `small` and `large`. The `small` project
builds a single library out of all the specified source (see `build.config`)
and as many programs (sources with a `main()`) as specified. The `large`
project builds multiple libaries out of the specified subdirectories, as well
as any programs (sources with a `main()`) that are specified in the
`build.config`.
