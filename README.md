# skeleton-c
A skeleton C project with Makefile

## Overview
This is a skeleton project in C. Can probably be used for C++ as well.
Included you will find the following:
1. A directory structure, in which you will create your source files
2. A portable GNU Makefile that will build on Linux and Windows (Windows
   builds require the `git-bash` prompt).
3. Am example `main_cli.c` source file.
4. Two example module source files and two header source files.

The module and headers are present only as an example. You must replace
them (or remove them) with your own modules.

## Output files
You should do a build immediately after cloning this repo, just to make
sure everything compiles as it is. To build you must do either `make
debug` or `make release`. The build will display all of the build
variables before a build is started. Doing a plain `make` will display a
list of targets that the user can build.

After building the project you will have either a `debug/` directory or a
`release` directory depending on whether you did `make debug` or `make
clean`. I'll assume you did `make debug` from this point; all the
directory names that start with `debug/` will be `release/` if you did
`make release`.

`debug/obs`:   Contains all the object files generated by the build.
`debug/bin`:   Contains all the programs files generated by the build.
`debug/lib`:   Contains all the library files generated by the build.

By default, all the modules in all the source files get packaged into a
single library `libskeleton.so` (`libskeleton.dll` on Windows). The string
`skeleton` gets replaced with the actual project name (which you will
change in the Makefile - see below).

There are two example modules: `module_one` and `module_two`. See the
`src/` directory for the sources and headers for these modules.
